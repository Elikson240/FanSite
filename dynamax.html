            <p>New to Pokemon Sword and Shield is Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing, both of which temporarily boost you Pokemon's power and allow it to grow to much larger sizes. However, Gigantamaxing is limited only to a select few of Pokemon and they take on a different form from their normal look. During a visit to a certain professor, two wishing stars fall from the sky and land next tot you and your rival. The next day you are visited by the professor and gifted a dynamax band. This allows you to dynamax or gigantamax your Pokemon but it's only available in areas called power spots so it's not possible to dynamax or gigantamax everywhere. Another new feature are the Pokemon raids found in Pokemon dens in the wild area. When entering the den you will face a dynamax Pokemon with the option to invite friends. Using dynamax candy obtained from raids, you can raise the level of dynamax power for your Pokemon.  </p>
