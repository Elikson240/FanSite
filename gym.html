            <p>Making a return after being absent in Pokemon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon are the Pokemon Gyms. And for the first time ever the two games, Sword and Shield, have version-exclusive gym leaders. Before you challenge the gym leaders you will now need to complete gym missions before proceeding. When participating in the gym challenge you will have to complete all gym missions and defeat all eight gym leaders then win the final tournament at the end of the game. After that you will be able to fight the champion and take the crown.</p>
